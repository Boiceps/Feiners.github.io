Not only does the song have over 1 billion streams on spotify, but it has trancended itself and become part of pop culture through memes and edits. Now FE!N is acknowledged as one of the most popular songs of this current generation, and this movement is spearheaded by noneother than Travis Scott.
				<h3>The Concerts</h3>
				<p>
					Travis' concerts have the reputation of being rowdy and lively, but when FE!N is being play, it gets ramped up to an 100. There were times where he played the song over 20 times, and that is where the phrase "They are Feining for more!" comes from. It refers to the feeling of wanting more but much more feinious.
				</p>
				<h3>Chorus Lyrics</h3>
				<p>
					FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N (Yeah)
					FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N (Yeah)
					FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N, FE!N
					FE!N, FE!N (Yeah), FE!N, FE!N, FE!N
